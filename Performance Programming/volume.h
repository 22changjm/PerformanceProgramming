// Volumes are used to represent the activations (i.e., state) between the
// different layers of the CNN. They all have three dimensions. The inter-
// pretation of their content depends on the layer that produced them. Before
// the first iteration, the Volume holds the data of the image we want to
// classify (the depth are the three color dimensions). After the last stage
// of the CNN, the Volume holds the probabilities that an image is part of
// a specific category.
//
// The weights are represented as a 1-d array with length
// width * height * depth.
